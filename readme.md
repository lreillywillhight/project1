MAZE_RUNNER

A primitive maze game (similar to Pac-Man). Player navigates a maze to the exit, where a new level is loaded.

MVP is a basic maze to navigate.

Stretch goals - multiple maps/environments monsters to avoid, keys/doors, powerups, bonus items(treasure)/points system, graphics/sound/animation, longer levels (screen scrolling? multiple rooms?), hazards, puppies? *PROCEDURAL MAP GENERATION*


DAY 1 - PURELY RESEARCH, FOLLOWED A TUTORIAL AND BROWSED EXAMPLES ON THE PHASER.IO WEBSITE

DAY 2 - MORE RESEARCH, GOT A TILEMAP TO TEST GAME ENVIRONMENT, SPENT ABOUT 6 HOURS GETTING THE DAMN THING TO LOAD INTO CHROME (PROBLEM WAS WITH HOW TILED HANDLES EMBEDDED TILESETS IN A TILEMAP. GETTING A CHARACTER AND COLLISION DETECTION SHOULD BE TRIVIAL... BIGGEST PROBLEM FACING ME RIGHT NOW IS HOW TO GENERATE MAPS (JSON) IN CONSOLE. WILL ASK A TA ABOUT IT, TOMORROW.
